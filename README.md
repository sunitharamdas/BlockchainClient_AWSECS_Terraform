# BlockchainClient_AWSECS_Terraform
Using Go implement a simple blockchain client â€“ the app should expose API,terraform  to deploy the application to AWS ECS Fargate

To implement a simple blockchain client in Go that interacts with the Polygon RPC endpoint (https://polygon-rpc.com/), we'll create a small HTTP server that exposes two API endpoints:

/blocknumber - To get the latest block number.

/block - To get block details by block number.

The application is currently a simple blockchain client that interacts with the Polygon RPC endpoint and exposes APIs to fetch block details.

Current Features
API Endpoints:

GET /blocknumber: Fetches the latest block number.

GET /block?number=<block_number>: Fetches block details by block number.

Docker Support: The application is containerized using Docker.

Terraform Configuration: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying the application to AWS ECS Fargate.
## Production Readiness Checklist
### Security
HTTPS:

Use HTTPS for all API endpoints to encrypt data in transit.

Configure the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to terminate SSL/TLS.

Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage SSL certificates.

### Authentication and Authorization:

Implement API key-based authentication or OAuth2 for securing API endpoints.

Use AWS IAM roles and policies to restrict access to AWS resources.

### Secrets Management:

Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

Avoid hardcoding secrets in the code or configuration files.

### Network Security:

Use AWS Security Groups and Network ACLs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.

Place the ECS tasks in private subnets and use a NAT gateway for outbound internet access.

### Vulnerability Scanning:

Use tools like Trivy or Clair to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

### Scalability
Auto Scaling:

Configure ECS Service Auto Scaling to handle increased traffic.

Use AWS Application Auto Scaling to adjust the number of ECS tasks based on CPU or memory utilization.

Load Balancing:

Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple ECS tasks.

Enable health checks to ensure only healthy tasks receive traffic.

### Database:

If the application requires a database, use a managed database service like Amazon RDS or Aurora.

Implement connection pooling and caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.
### Monitoring and Logging
Logging:

Use AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize and monitor application logs.

Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for better log analysis.

Metrics:

Use AWS CloudWatch Metrics to monitor ECS task performance (e.g., CPU, memory, network usage).

Export custom application metrics using Prometheus or CloudWatch.

Alerts:

Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify the team of critical issues (e.g., high CPU usage, failed health checks).

Use AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts via email or SMS.
### High Availability
Multi-AZ Deployment:

Deploy ECS tasks across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure fault tolerance.

Use an ALB to route traffic to healthy tasks in different AZs.

### Backup and Restore:

Regularly back up critical data (e.g., databases) and store backups in S3 with versioning enabled.

Test the restore process to ensure data can be recovered in case of failure.

### Disaster Recovery:

Implement a disaster recovery plan with a secondary AWS region.

Use AWS Backup to automate backups and cross-region replication.
Disaster Recovery
Backup Strategy:

Regularly back up application data and configurations.

Use AWS Backup to automate and manage backups.

Failover Strategy:

Implement a failover strategy to switch to a secondary region in case of a major outage.

Use Route 53 DNS failover to route traffic to the secondary region.
